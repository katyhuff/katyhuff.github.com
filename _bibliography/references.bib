	abstract = {Cyclus is the next-generation agent-based nuclear fuel cycle simulator, providing flexibility to users and developers through adynamic resource exchange solver and plug-in, user-developed agent framework.
The goal of Cyclus is to enable a broad spectrum of fuel cycle simulation while providing a low barrier to entry for new users and agent developers. Cyclus engages with potential module developers and encourages them to join a vibrant community in anexpanding ecosystem. Users and developers are always welcome and encouraged to use or contribute to the Cyclus project.},

	abstract = {Simulation of the nuclear fuel cycle is an established field with multiple players. Prior development work has utilized tech- niques such as system dynamics to provide a solution structure for the matching of supply and demand in these simulations. In general, however, simulation infrastructure development has occured in relatively closed circles, each effort having unique considerations as to the cases which are desired to be modeled. Accordingly, individual simulators tend to have their design decisions driven by specific use cases. Presented in this work is a proposed supply and demand matching algorithm that lever- ages the techniques of the well-studied field of mathematical programming. A generic approach is achieved by treating fa- cilities as individual entities and actors in the supply-demand market which denote preferences amongst commodities. Using such a framework allows for varying levels of interaction fi- delity, ranging from low-fidelity, quick solutions to high-fidelity solutions that model individual transactions (e.g. at the fuel- assembly level). The power of the technique is that it allows such flexibility while still treating the problem in a generic man- ner, encapsulating simulation engine design decisions in such a way that future simulation requirements can be relatively easily added when needed.},

	abstract = {The University of California, Berkeley (UCB), has developed a preconceptual design for a commercial pebble-bed (PB), fluoride salt–cooled, high-temperature reactor (FHR) (PB-FHR). The baseline design for this Mark-I PB-FHR (Mk1) plant is a 236-MW(thermal) reactor. The Mk1 uses a fluoride salt coolant with solid, coated-particle pebble fuel. The Mk1 design differs from earlier FHR designs because it uses a nuclear air-Brayton combined cycle designed to produce 100 MW(electric) of base-load electricity using a modified General Electric 7FB gas turbine. For peak electricity generation, the Mk1 has the ability to boost power output up to 242 MW(electric) using natural gas co-firing. The Mk1 uses direct heating of the power conversion fluid (air) with the primary coolant salt rather than using an intermediate coolant loop. By combining results from computational neutronics, thermal hydraulics, and pebble dynamics, UCB has developed a detailed design of the annular core and other key functional features. Both an active normal shutdown cooling system and a passive, natural-circulation-driven emergency decay heat removal system are included. Computational models of the FHR-validated using experimental data from the literature and from scaled thermal-hydraulic facilities-have led to a set of design criteria and system requirements for the Mk1 to operate safely and reliably. Three-dimensional, computer-aided-design models derived from the Mk1 design criteria are presented.},

	abstract = {The theory of non-ideal gases in thermodynamic equilibrium, for instance the van der Waals gas model, has played a central role in the understanding of coexisting phases. Here, we report a combined experimental, numerical and theoretical study of a liquid-solid-like phase transition which takes place in a vertically vibrated fluidized granular monolayer. The first experimental setup is a long, narrow channel, with a width of the order of a few particle diameters, hence the dynamics is quasi-one-dimensional. We have considered this configuration to characterize the dynamic behavior of the phase transition. The second setup is used to measure the pressure as function of particle density in order to clarify the physical mechanism behind this phase transition. We demonstrate that the transition is mediated by waves and that it is triggered by a negative compressibility as in van der Waals phase coexistence, although the system does not satisfy the hypotheses used to understand atomic systems. Finally, in order to further characterize this phase transition, we study static and dynamic correlation functions, and bond-orientational order parameters.},
